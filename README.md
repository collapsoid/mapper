# Mapper

 Mapper is a project that allows you to search for cities and set your own marks on the map, neither more nor less. Thanks to this incredible combination, an amazing opportunity opens up to explore the world, being right in front of the screen of your monitor!
Here is a list of useful features to help you travel:
- **Search for a city by name**  
 Just type the city you are interested in the search bar and the application will immediately take you to its outskirts. Wow?
- **Own tags**  
 Do not know where you would like to go or just need a label that is not tied to the subject? Add an exclamation mark at the beginning of your query and the desired label appears directly in the center of the map. Like this: "! MyPlace"
- **Polylines**  
 Probably, at this point you will already notice that the marks are connected by lines in the order in which you add new places. This is another opportunity that will allow you to be creative! Or something else, I don’t know, I took this function from a test task, I don’t know how this can help. Draw your own Bermuda Triangle after all!
[//]: # - **Swap**  
[//]: # Have you noticed that your list of cities is not in the proper sequence for you and don’t know how to get out of this situation without deleting existing cities? Do not worry, because it was for such cases that the ability to sort the list on the spot was introduced! Just drag your favorite city to another position in the list of cities and voila.  

 What an abundance of possibilities, you think, how can I deal with all this? Give it a try. All these are just tools that will greatly assist you in exploring the whole world! And they are incredibly useful.  
 *Enjoy your use!*

 The application is built on the basis of a test task provided by Hexlet in conjunction with Funbox. [Link](https://dl.funbox.ru/qt-js.pdf) to the task.
